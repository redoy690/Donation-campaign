# I will describe here three features about my project:

## 1. Showing all donation cards:
Firstly I have a home page in this project. Users can easily see all donation options on the home page. Here user also gets a search option. To use this search button users can easily get any donation card. After clicking a donation card, the user get the donation information page. On the donation information page, users see the donation description and donation price. Then user can easily click the donate button and complete the user donation.

## 2. All donation List:
Users can easily see users all donations on the "Donation" page. Here users see only those cards that user already donate. Here users see donation cards with donation Pictures, Titles, Categories, and Prices. If a user donates more than 4 donations, the user sees a "See All" button. By default user get here 4 cards. After clicking this "See All" button user get all donated cards. 

## 3. Pie Chart Calculation:
Users can easily see the donation percentage with a pie chart on the "Statistics" page. Here users see a pie chart with total donation and my donation. After seeing this pie chart users can easily understand how many donations total i have given.
